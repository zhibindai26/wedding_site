                <b>Update</b>: Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided to postpone
                our wedding until later this year.
                We are currently working to determine a suitable replacement date and will notify
                invited guests directly when there is more concrete information. We have closed RSVPs for now. Thank you for your understanding
                during this difficult time. Please stay safe and healthy! <br><br>

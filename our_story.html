                                        Ahoy, I also think it's very important that a partner smell not bad. I'm
                                        interested in meeting people that I don't work with and who will draw me off of campus, which could mean anything
                                        between staying in (somewhere other than my "in") and going out. I'll admit I don't know a lot of
                                        the favorite things you've mentioned...but...I really like Mexican food, which I miss dearly. Either way, hope you enjoy Beijing and it's unique, if not pleasant, aroma.

                                        and direct your profile is --most people just write a bunch of garbage.

                                        Hanging out could be cool. I'm legitimately pretty busy right now (not being
                                        coy) with finals coming up - lots of prep work. I'm hoping to force myself to be sociable next week.
                                        I'm in Haidian, what about you? And what sort of hanging out do you partake in?
                                        Heads up, I'm not much for drinking. I'm happy to go to bars but I make no promise to imbibe
                                        alcohol. Some find that distasteful. Thanks for appreciating my lack of garbage. I'm quirky and I know it. Others should know it, too.

                                        Next week would be good. I'm pretty busy until January too, but we can figure
                                        something out. I also live in Haidian, near zhongguancun. I'm pretty much down for anything, but usually I'll just do typical stuff
                                        -restaurants, bars, movies, etc. Especially since its hard to do outdoor stuff during winter.

                                        Hi, Zhibin, Your face flashed across my facebook page - I guess we're both in the DC-Metro
                                        area and the algorithm did the rest. If you are indeed near DC and have any interest in
                                        meeting up, drop me a line (<span>301-867-5309</span>). If you are not near DC
                                        or (perhaps more accurately) have no desire to meet, that's fine too. I hope you're doing well and staying warm! Sarah

                        <p><strong>The Rings</strong>: Before 2018, I never thought about engagement rings (or any wedding paraphernalia, for that matter). Even when Zhibin and I began discussing marriage, I still wasn't thinking about putting a ring on it. 
                            When we decided that marriage is, indeed, something we'd like to pursue, Zhibin asked what kind of ring I'd like. My initial reaction was "Why?" and then "Ugh, that's expensive!" and "I don't like diamonds!" and finally "Do I have to?"<br><br>

                            Meanwhile, I had applied to library and information science graduate programs, and I was deciding where to go. University of Michigan hosted an accepted students' weekend, so I went to check it out and visit my good friend, 
                            Katie, who lives just outside of Ann Arbor. We got coffee, she gave me a pocket dictionary of Chinese and German because that's what we do, and after running me around the campus she took me to her favorite antiques shop.<br><br>
                            
                            They had Art Deco. They had Midcentury. They had sapphires as central stones and square cut diamonds, the only kind I like. We checked the clock. One hour before the accepted students' kickoff. With Katie's and the shop owner's help, 
                            I tried on two sapphires and chose the less ostentatious one after checking its purpleish hue in the natural light of the outside alley - engagement ring, CHECK. The shop owner found a band with tiny diamonds that nearly 
                            matched - wedding band, CHECK. And because I was so far under budget, I treated myself to a Midcentury band with tiny square cut diamonds that looks straight out of Star Trek - second engagement ring, CHECK. Because 2 > 1, right?<br><br>
                            
                            HURDLE! I hadn't told my bank that I was traveling because I wasn't planning on using my debit card. Card rejected. HURDLE! The rings needed to be resized but it was the weekend and they wouldn't be done before I flew back to Maryland. 
                            HURDLE! I HAD TO GET TO THE CAMPUS EVENT! But with a small business owner, an education professional, and a future librarian, we had it covered.<br><br>
                            
                            I ran to campus and plopped into a seat right as the welcoming speeches began. At the break, I went back to the shop. We measured my fingers and the shop owner said she'd mail the resized rings with a special courier service. 
                            I called Zhibin and he got a check in the mail. I enjoyed the rest of the weekend on Michigan's dime but ended up sticking with University of Maryland for the in-state tuition. Thanks to Michigan, I have the only engagement rings 
                            I'd ever really want to wear. So while I may be a Terrapin, there's a special place in my heart for the Wolverines.

                        <br>
                        <p><strong>The Proposal</strong>: We had a trip to China planned for April, and after getting
                            the rings, I wanted to propose before or during the trip. Initially, I planned to propose at
                            Victoria Peak in Hong Kong on the first day of our trip. I began second guessing this because 
                            I was worried it would be crowded and I would fudge the whole thing up. We were also flying 
                            to Hong Kong in business class and I wanted to enjoy that without stressing about the proposal. 
                            So I axed Plan A.<br><br>

                            Plan B was to go hiking in Shenandoah National Park and propose there. I made plans for us
                            to go hiking the weekend before we left for China.
                            Unfortunately a couple days before that, I became sick with a sinus problem, so we couldn't
                            really go hiking. Plan B axed.<br><br>

                            At this point, I didn't know what to do, and I didn't have a lot of time to do it! I thought
                            about proposing in front of Sarah's mom San-Dee's house just to get it over with,
                            but the more I thought about this, the more it seemed like a great idea. Sarah's mom would
                            be there to see it happen (and take photos), there were flowers on the lawn to
                            provide some nice visuals, and most importantly, it could come together last-minute.<br><br>

                            I coordinated with San-Dee and Sarah and I drove over to her house. After we arrived, I
                            asked Sarah to stay outside for a minute. Then I came out with the rings, got down on two
                            knees (because 2 > 1) and asked Sarah to marry me. She said "yes"; I said "thank you".
